### Preparing a routing

You want to make sure that, when you start the routine, that you don't have to waste a bunch of time getting things set properly. When exporting from Ableton you want to:

- get levels perfect so you don't have to adjust gain after loading in your dj software
- export everything warped to the same bpm
- export silence if needed before the start

Once you import into your dj software:
- set cue points and loops where needed

bonus tip: in Traktor, you can set a cue point AFTER the song has ended. You can do this if you're using dvs and don't have an instant start button. Set a cue point at the end of the track so you're effectively playing silence. When you're ready to bang the track in you can just hit another cue point button instead of hitting a button and trying to move faders all in one quick series of motions. You won't be fast enough to do it smoothly.

for short snippets (or loops) use remix decks. You have 4 slots on each side.
